## Intent

Create a private blank repository called "web_agent" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to create a private blank repository called "web_agent" using the right template. The action history shows the agent attempted to select a template but encountered errors, and then filled the project name field with "web_agent". The final state description indicates that the form fields are visible, the project name is filled, and the visibility is set to private, but the "Create project" button has not been clicked. Without clicking the "Create project" button, the repository creation process is not completed, so the task fails.

Status: failure

===============
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the "Create from template" tab has bid 242, but the error indicates it couldn't be found. Let me check the current state - I'm on the "New Project" page and the tablist shows three tabs: "Blank project" (238), "Create from template" (242), and "Import project" (246). The "Blank project" tab is currently selected.

Since the element exists in the accessibility tree but wasn't found when I tried to click it, I should first try to click the "Create from template" tab directly.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab (bid 242) is focused and selected according to the accessibility tree. However, my previous action failed to find element 242. Since the element is clearly present in the accessibility tree, I should try clicking it directly to select the template creation option.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab (bid 242) is already focused and selected according to the accessibility tree attributes. The tab is marked as `focused, selected=True`. Since the template selection interface is already visible (showing various templates like Ruby on Rails, Spring, etc.), I don't need to click the tab again. Instead, I should proceed to select a blank template option to create a private repository called "web_agent".

From the template options shown, I need to find a blank or minimal template. Looking at the available templates, I see options like "Pages/Plain HTML" which would be a good choice for a blank starting point. The radio button for this template has bid 441.
===============Looking at the error message, I can see that the radio button element (bid 441) is being intercepted by the "Use template" span element (bid 442). This suggests that the radio button itself might not be the clickable element - instead, I should click on the label or the "Use template" text that's associated with the radio button.

From the accessibility tree, I can see that the "Pages/Plain HTML" template has a LabelText element containing the radio button and the "Use template" text. The label element would be a better target for clicking since it's designed to activate the radio button.

Let me try clicking on the label element that contains the "Use template" text for the "Pages/Plain HTML" template.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already selected and the template selection interface is visible. The "Pages/Plain HTML" template appears to be a good choice for a blank starting point. However, my previous attempts to click the radio button (441) and label (440) failed due to element interception issues.

Let me try a different approach - I'll click on the "Use template" text directly, which has bid 442 according to the error message from my previous action. This should select the template without the interception issue.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already selected and the template interface is visible. However, my attempts to click specific template elements (440, 441, 442) have failed due to visibility issues.

Let me try a different approach. I notice there's a "Change template" button (bid 537) that might open a template selection dialog. This could be a more reliable way to select a template since it's clearly visible and clickable in the current interface.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already selected and the template interface is visible. However, my previous attempts to click specific template elements have failed due to visibility or interception issues.

The goal is to create a private blank repository called "web_agent" using a template. Since I'm already on the template selection page, I should look for a more reliable way to proceed. I notice there are form fields for project name and visibility settings that should appear after selecting a template, but I haven't successfully selected one yet.

Let me try selecting a different template option that might be more accessible. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the "Pages/Plain HTML" template has multiple associated elements. Let me try clicking on the main template container or description area instead of the specific radio button or label.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm on the "Create from template" tab and have been trying to select the "Pages/Plain HTML" template, but my clicks on various elements (440, 441, 442, 433) have failed due to visibility or interception issues.

Let me try a different template that might be more accessible. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the "Ruby on Rails" template has a similar structure with a radio button (333) and "Use template" text (332). Let me try clicking on the "Use template" text for the Ruby on Rails template, which should be bid 332.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm on the "Create from template" tab and have been trying unsuccessfully to select various templates by clicking on different elements (radio buttons, labels, "Use template" text). The error messages indicate visibility or interception issues with these elements.

However, I notice that the form fields for project creation are already visible in the current state - I can see the project name field (bid 543) is focused, the project slug field (bid 554), and the visibility level radio buttons. This suggests that a template might already be selected (likely the default Ruby on Rails template shown in the interface).

Since the goal is to create a private blank repository called "web_agent", I should proceed with filling out the form with the correct information. I can:
1. Fill in the project name as "web_agent"
2. Ensure the visibility is set to "Private" (which appears to be already selected based on the accessibility tree showing radio button 566 as checked)
3. Click the "Create project" button

Let me start by filling the project name field:

The detailed final state of the webpage:

Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm on the "Create from template" tab and have been trying unsuccessfully to select various templates by clicking on different elements (radio buttons, labels, "Use template" text). The error messages indicate visibility or interception issues with these elements.

However, I notice that the form fields for project creation are already visible in the current state - I can see the project name field (bid 543) is focused, the project slug field (bid 554), and the visibility level radio buttons. This suggests that a template might already be selected (likely the default Ruby on Rails template shown in the interface).

Since the goal is to create a private blank repository called "web_agent", I should proceed with filling out the form with the correct information. I can:
1. Fill in the project name as "web_agent"
2. Ensure the visibility is set to "Private" (which appears to be already selected based on the accessibility tree showing radio button 566 as checked)
