## Intent

Show me the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task where the user wants to know the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the repository, clicked the "Clone" button, and then clicked an element (bid 493) that expanded the clone options, making the SSH command visible. The final state confirms the SSH clone command is displayed in a textbox. The agent's response correctly provides the exact command from the webpage. The actions taken were sufficient to locate and retrieve the required information.

Status: success

## Final Response "The command to clone ChatGPT with SSH is: git clone git@localhost:convexegg/chatgpt.git"

===============
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the search results show a repository called "Convex Eggtart / Chatgpt" with a link to `http://172.26.116.102:8080/convexegg/chatgpt`. The repository name appears in a heading element with bid 281, but the error indicates this bid couldn't be found. Let me click on the repository link directly using its visible bid.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see we're currently on the ChatGPT repository page in GitLab. The user wants to see the command to clone this repository using SSH.

I notice there's a "Clone" button/link with bid 493 in the accessibility tree. This is likely where the clone options are located. I should click on this to reveal the clone commands, including the SSH option.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the "Clone" button (bid 493) is already expanded (expanded=True) and focused. The clone options are already visible below it, including the "Clone with SSH" section.

The SSH clone command is displayed in a textbox with bid 500 and value 'git@localhost:convexegg/chatgpt.git'. Since the user wants to see the command to clone with SSH, and it's already visible on the page, I should simply send this command to the user.
