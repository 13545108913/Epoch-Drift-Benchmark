## Intent

Invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborator to my HTML5 markup extention repo

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborators to an HTML5 markup extension repo, which is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent entered both names and pressed Enter, then clicked on the role permission combobox (bid 499). However, the final state indicates that while the names were selected, the role was still set to "Guest" by default, and the agent was planning to change it to "Developer" but did not complete that action. Since the role was not updated and the collaborators were not actually added with the correct permissions (or added at all, as the final step of confirming the addition is missing), the task is not successfully completed.

Status: failure

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============Looking at the goal to invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborators to my "HTML5 markup extension repo", I need to first identify which repository this refers to. From the project list, I can see several relevant repositories:

- "accessible-html-content-patterns" (description mentions "The full HTML5 Doctor Element Index as well as common markup patterns")
- "a11y-syntax-highlighting"
- "a11y-webring.club"

The "accessible-html-content-patterns" repository seems most likely to be the HTML5 markup extension repo based on its description. I'll click on this project to navigate to its page where I can manage collaborators.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "accessible-html-content-patterns" repository page. To invite collaborators, I need to navigate to the project settings where I can manage members. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 395.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Settings page for the "accessible-html-content-patterns" repository (the URL ends with "/edit"). To invite collaborators, I need to navigate to the Members section where I can add new project members. I can see a "Members" link in the settings sidebar with bid 407.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "Members" page for the "accessible-html-content-patterns" repository. The page shows an "Invite member" tab with a search box for selecting members to invite. I need to search for Benoît and Abishek to invite them as collaborators. I can see the search box has bid 491.
===============Looking at the current state, I'm on the Members page with the search box focused (bid 491). I need to search for "Benoît" first to find and select this user. I'll type the name into the search box.
===============Looking at the current state, I've just filled the search box with "Benoît" and can see from the accessibility tree that there's a result available for "Benoît Blanchon @bblanchon" (bid 768). The status message indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it." I should now select this user by pressing Enter to confirm the selection.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that Benoît Blanchon has been successfully selected from the search results (the status message shows "Benoît Blanchon @bblanchon"). Now I need to search for and add Abishek as well. I should click on the search box again to search for the second user.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that Benoît Blanchon has been selected (visible in the listitem with bid 775), and the search box (bid 491) is now empty and ready for the next search. I need to search for "Abishek" to find and invite the second collaborator. I'll type "Abishek" into the search box.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after typing "Abishek" in the search box, the accessibility tree shows a result for "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" (bid 939) is available in the dropdown list. The status message indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it." I should now select this user by pressing Enter to confirm the selection, which will add Abishek as the second collaborator to be invited.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that both Benoît Blanchon and Abishek S have been successfully selected as members to invite (visible in the listitems with bids 775 and 946 respectively). Now I need to set their role permissions and then add them to the project. I can see the role permission combobox (bid 499) is currently set to "Guest" by default. Since these are collaborators who will likely need to contribute code, I should set them to at least "Developer" role. I'll click on the role combobox to change the permission level.
