Thoughts: The user's intent is to open their latest created issue containing "better" in the title and check if it is closed. The agent navigated to issue #10, which has "Better sharing solution" in the title, and correctly identified its status as "Open" from the webpage's accessibility tree. The agent's response to the user states the issue is open, not closed, which matches the final state of the webpage. Since this is an information-seeking task, the agent provided the correct status information, fulfilling the user's request.

## Final Response "The issue 'Better sharing solution' (#10

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To find my latest created issue with "better" in its title, I need to navigate to the issues section first. I can see there's an "Issues" link in the sidebar navigation with a notification badge showing "10" issues assigned to me.

I'll click on the Issues link to go to my issues dashboard where I can search and filter for issues containing "better" in the title.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Issues dashboard (as indicated by the page title "Issues · Dashboard · GitLab" and the active "Issues" link in the sidebar). I can see several issues listed, and I need to find the latest created issue that has "better" in its title.

From the accessibility tree, I can see two issues with "better" in their titles:
- "Better sharing solution" (created 8 years ago)
- "Better initial load experience" (created 8 years ago)

Both were created at the same time, but I need to check which one is the latest. Since they have the same creation time, I should click on the first one to check its status. The link for "Better sharing solution" has bid 453.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Better sharing solution" issue page (issue #10). The goal is to check if this issue is closed. From the accessibility tree, I can see the status indicator shows "Open" (visible in the navigation section with "StaticText 'Open'"). This means the issue is currently open, not closed. Since this appears to be the latest issue with "better" in its title (based on the previous navigation), I can now report this finding to the user.
