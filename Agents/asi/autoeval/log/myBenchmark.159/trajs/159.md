## Intent

Submit a merge request for the branch that implements the support of template strings to be merged into master branch, assign myself and Roshan as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to submit a merge request for a specific branch ("that implements the support of template strings") into the master branch, assigning themselves and Roshan as reviewers. The action history shows the agent attempted to search for the branch using terms like "template" and "string" but failed to find it, as indicated by the final state. The final state explicitly states that the branch might not exist or have a different name, and the target branch is incorrectly set to "add-color-utility-classes" instead of "master." The agent did not successfully create the merge request, assign reviewers, or correct the target branch to "master." Therefore, the task is a failure.

Status: failure

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab repository page for the "a11yproject.com" project, specifically viewing the "add-color-utility-classes" branch. To submit a merge request for this branch to be merged into master, I need to navigate to the Merge Requests section first.

I can see in the navigation there's a "Merge Requests" link with the text "Merge Requests 0" which indicates there are currently no merge requests. This is exactly what I need to click to get to the merge request creation page.
===============Looking at the current page state after clicking the "Merge Requests" link, I can see I'm now on the Merge Requests page. The accessibility tree shows there's a "New merge request" link available (bid 476), which is exactly what I need to create a merge request for the branch that implements template strings support.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the "New Merge Request" page. The accessibility tree shows:

- Source branch selection (bid 498) - currently shows "Select source branch"
- Target branch selection (bid 541) - currently shows "add-color-utility-classes"
- A "Compare branches and continue" button (bid 582)

I need to:
1. Select the source branch that implements template strings support
2. Ensure target branch is "master" (currently shows "add-color-utility-classes" which is wrong)
3. Assign myself and Roshan as reviewers

First, I need to select the correct source branch. Since the goal mentions "the branch that implements the support of template strings," I need to click the source branch dropdown to select that branch.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the source branch dropdown (bid 498), the dropdown is now expanded and showing a list of available branches. I need to find the branch that implements template strings support. Scanning through the branch list, I can see various branches but none that explicitly mention "template strings" in their names.

However, I notice there are several feature branches and fork branches. Since the goal specifically mentions "the branch that implements the support of template strings," I should search for it in the search box that's currently focused (bid 507). This will help me quickly locate the correct branch.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've searched for "template" in the branch search box (bid 507) and the results show "No matching results" (bid 615). This suggests there might not be a branch with "template" in its name, or the branch might have a different naming convention.

Since the search didn't find any matching branches, I should clear the search and browse through the available branches to find the one that implements template strings support. Let me clear the search field first.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after clearing the search field, I should now be able to see all available branches in the dropdown. Since the search for "template" returned no results, I need to manually browse through the branch list to find the branch that implements template strings support.

The branch might have a different name like "feature/template-strings", "template-support", or something similar. Let me scroll through the branch list to find the correct branch.
===============Looking at the current situation, I've been trying to find the branch that implements template strings support but haven't been successful. The search for "template" returned no results, and I was about to scroll through the branch list. However, I realize I may be approaching this incorrectly.

Let me reconsider the goal: I need to submit a merge request for "the branch that implements the support of template strings." Since I can't find a branch with "template" in its name, perhaps:

1. The branch might have a completely different name
2. The branch might already be selected or visible
3. I might need to look at the current branch context differently

Looking back at the initial accessibility tree, I notice that the target branch is currently set to "add-color-utility-classes" (bid 541), but this doesn't seem to be the template strings branch. Let me first close the source branch dropdown since it's currently open and not helping me find the right branch, then reconsider my approach.
===============Looking at the current situation, I realize I may have been overcomplicating this. The goal is to submit a merge request for the branch that implements template strings support, but I haven't been able to find such a branch through search. Let me reconsider the context.

From the initial accessibility tree, I can see that:
- I'm currently on the "add-color-utility-classes" branch (target branch shows this)
- The source branch dropdown is where I need to select the template strings branch

Since I can't find a branch with "template" in the name, perhaps the template strings implementation is in a different branch, or maybe I need to look at the current branch more carefully. Let me try a different search term that might be more comprehensive.
===============Looking at the error message, it appears the search box (bid 507) is not currently visible or accessible, likely because the branch dropdown was closed when I clicked "504" in my previous action. The dropdown needs to be open to search for branches.

Let me reopen the source branch dropdown first, then search for "string" to find the template strings implementation branch.
===============Looking at the current situation, I realize I've been struggling to find the branch with template strings support. The search for "template" and "string" haven't yielded results, suggesting the branch might have a completely different name or might not exist yet.

However, I notice from the initial accessibility tree that the target branch is currently set to "add-color-utility-classes" (bid 541), but the goal requires merging into "master" branch. Let me first correct the target branch to "master" since that's clearly wrong, then continue searching for the source branch with template strings support.

The target branch dropdown should allow me to select "master" as the target for the merge request.
