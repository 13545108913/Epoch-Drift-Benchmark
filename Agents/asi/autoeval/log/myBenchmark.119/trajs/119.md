===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab project page for "dotfiles". To create a milestone for merging all branches to main from March 15, 2044 to March 30, 2044, I need to navigate to the milestones section.

I can see in the accessibility tree that there's a "Milestones" link in the left sidebar navigation with the URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/dashboard/milestones". This appears to be the global milestones dashboard. However, since I want to create a milestone specifically for this project, I should look for project-specific milestones.

Let me first navigate to the issues section of this project, as milestones are typically managed from there in GitLab.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm in the Issues section of the dotfiles project. I notice that in the sub-navigation under "Issues 0", there's a "Milestones" link with the URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles/-/milestones". This is exactly what I need - the project-specific milestones page where I can create a new milestone for this project.

I should click on this Milestones link to navigate to the milestones management page for this specific project.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm already on the milestones page for the dotfiles project (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles/-/milestones). The accessibility tree shows there's a "New milestone" link with bid 495, and the page currently shows "No milestones to show" which confirms I'm in the right place to create a new milestone.

Since I need to create a milestone for merging all branches to main from March 15, 2044 to March 30, 2044, I should click the "New milestone" link to access the milestone creation form.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New Milestone" page for the dotfiles project. The form has several fields I need to fill out:
- A "Title" textbox (bid 482) that's currently focused and required
- A "Description" textbox (bid 519)
- A "Start Date" textbox (bid 553)
- A "Due Date" textbox (bid 560)
- A "Create milestone" button (bid 564) that's currently disabled

I need to create a milestone for merging all branches to main from March 15, 2044 to March 30, 2044. I'll start by filling in the title field first since it's required and currently focused.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the title field has already been filled with "Merge all branches to main" from my previous action. Now I need to set the start date and due date for the milestone. The form has a "Start Date" field (bid 553) and "Due Date" field (bid 560). I need to set the start date to March 15, 2044 and the due date to March 30, 2044.

I'll start by filling in the start date field first.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the start date field (bid 553) has been successfully filled with "2044-03-15". Now I need to set the due date to March 30, 2044. I can see there's a "Due Date" textbox with bid 560 that I need to fill with the end date.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:
- The title field is already filled with "Merge all branches to main"
- The start date field is filled with "2044-03-15"
- The due date field is filled with "2044-03-30"

All the required information for creating the milestone has been entered. Now I need to submit the form by clicking the "Create milestone" button (bid 564) to actually create the milestone with these settings.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the milestone details page for "Merge all branches to main" with the dates correctly set to March 15, 2044–March 30, 2044. The milestone has been successfully created and is showing as "Upcoming" with 0% completion. The goal of creating a milestone for merging all branches to main with the specified dates has been accomplished. I should inform the user that the milestone has been successfully created.
