## Intent

Add the following users to my time tracking tool as guest: ['yjlou']

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content modification task where the user wants to add a specific user as a guest to a time tracking tool. The action history shows the agent performed a series of clicks, filled in the username, pressed Enter, and clicked another element. The final state of the webpage explicitly confirms that "yjlou" has been successfully added as a guest, with the user listed in the "Existing members and groups" section with the correct role and recent timestamp. The agent's actions and the final webpage state demonstrate successful completion of the task.

Status: success

## Final Response "Successfully added user 'yjlou' as a guest to the time tracking tool."

===============Looking at the current page, I can see this is a GitLab dashboard showing projects. To add users to a time tracking tool as guests, I need to first identify which project contains the time tracking tool. Based on the project list, I can see there's a project called "Byte Blaze / timeit" which appears to be a time tracking tool based on its description "Rails implementation of time tracking tool timeit". This is likely the time tracking tool mentioned in the goal.

I should navigate to this project first to access its member management settings where I can add users as guests.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / timeit" project page, which is the time tracking tool. To add users as guests, I need to navigate to the project settings where I can manage members. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 395.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already in the Settings section of the timeit project (as indicated by the URL ending in "/edit" and the "General Settings" heading). To add users as guests, I need to navigate to the Members section specifically, which I can see in the sidebar under Settings. There's a "Members" link with bid 407 that should take me to the member management page where I can add users.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the timeit project (URL ends with "/project_members"). The page shows an "Invite member" section where I can search for users and assign them roles. I can see:

1. A search box with bid '490' labeled "Select members to invite"
2. A role dropdown with bid '498' currently set to "Guest" (which matches the goal)
3. An "Add to project" button with bid '512' (currently disabled)

To add the user 'yjlou' as a guest, I need to:
1. Search for the user in the search box
2. The role is already set to "Guest" so no change needed
3. Click the "Add to project" button once it becomes enabled

I'll start by searching for the user 'yjlou' in the member search box.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled the search box with "yjlou" and the accessibility tree shows that the search box now has the value "yjlou". I can also see in the tree that there's a dropdown result showing "yjlou @yjlou" as an available option (bid 607).

The "Add to project" button (bid 512) is currently disabled, which means I need to select the user from the search results first. The status message at the bottom indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it." I should press Enter to select the user from the search results, which should enable the "Add to project" button.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter to select the user "yjlou" from the search results, the accessibility tree now shows "yjlou @yjlou" in the status area, indicating the user has been selected. The role dropdown is still set to "Guest" (which matches our goal), and the "Add to project" button (bid 512) should now be enabled since a user has been selected. I need to click the "Add to project" button to complete the process of adding yjlou as a guest to the time tracking tool.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the user "yjlou" has been successfully added as a guest to the time tracking tool. The accessibility tree shows a status message "Users were successfully added." and I can see "yjlou" listed in the "Existing members and groups" section with the role "Guest" and access given "just now". This confirms that the goal has been accomplished - the user yjlou has been added as a guest to the time tracking tool.

Since the task is complete, I should notify the user that the operation was successful.
