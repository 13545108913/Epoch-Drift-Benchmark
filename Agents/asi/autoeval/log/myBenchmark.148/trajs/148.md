The action history shows the agent clicking through to select the Jekyll template, filling in the repository name, and confirming creation. The final state confirms the project "11711_gitlab" was successfully imported, is private, and contains the Jekyll template structure. This is a content modification task, and the agent's actions and the final state indicate the task was completed successfully.

Status: success

## Final Response "Successfully created a private Jekyll repository called '11711_gitlab' using the Jekyll template. The project has been imported and is ready for development."

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard with a "New project" button visible. To create a private Jekyll repository called "11711_gitlab" using a template, I should click the "New project" button to start the project creation process.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the "New Project" page. The goal is to create a private Jekyll repository using a template. Currently, the "Blank project" tab is selected, but I need to switch to the "Create from template" tab to access Jekyll templates. The tab has bid 242.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already focused and selected (selected=True). The page shows various template options including "Pages/Jekyll" which is exactly what we need. I can see the Jekyll template option with a radio button (bid 429) that says "Use template". I should select this radio button to choose the Jekyll template for our project.
===============Looking at the error message, I can see that the radio button element (bid 429) is being intercepted by other elements on the page - specifically a span element (bid 430) and sometimes a help dropdown link (bid 174). The radio button itself is visible and enabled, but other elements are blocking the click.

Since the radio button is being intercepted, I should try clicking on the label text instead, which is typically associated with the radio button and should trigger the same selection. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a LabelText element (bid 428) that contains the radio button and the "Use template" text. I should click on the label text "Use template" which has bid 430.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already selected and the Jekyll template is displayed. The project creation form is visible with the Jekyll template pre-selected. Now I need to:

1. Fill in the project name as "11711_gitlab"
2. Ensure the project is set to private (which appears to be the default based on the checked radio button)
3. Click "Create project"

The project name field (bid 543) is currently focused, so I can directly fill it with the desired project name. The slug field (bid 554) will automatically update based on the project name. The visibility is already set to "Private" (radio button bid 566 is checked), which matches our requirement.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 543) has already been filled with "11711_gitlab" from my previous action. The form shows that:

- The Jekyll template is selected
- The project name is set to "11711_gitlab"
- The project slug has automatically updated to "11711_gitlab"
- The visibility level is already set to "Private" (radio button bid 566 is checked)

All the requirements are now met:
- Private repository ✓
- Name "11711_gitlab" ✓
- Jekyll template ✓

The next logical step is to click the "Create project" button to finalize the creation of the repository.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see we're now on the project page for "11711_gitlab" with the message "The project was successfully imported." This indicates that the Jekyll repository creation was successful. The page shows:

- Project name: "11711_gitlab" ✓
- Jekyll template structure is present (with _includes, _layouts, _posts folders, etc.) ✓
- Project is private (no indication it's public) ✓
- Jekyll-specific files like Gemfile, _config.yml are present ✓

The goal has been accomplished - we've successfully created a private Jekyll repository called "11711_gitlab" using the Jekyll template. I should notify the user that the task is complete.
