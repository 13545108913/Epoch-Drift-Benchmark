The action history shows the agent performed a series of clicks, filled "Vinta" into a field, pressed Enter, and clicked another element. The final state of the webpage confirms that Vinta Chen (@vinta) has been successfully added as a guest with the role "Guest" and a status message "Users were successfully added." This matches the user's intent to invite Vinta as a guest to check the dotfile configurations, so the task is successfully completed.

Status: success

===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed at the bottom with bid 901. Since Vinta wants to check my dotfile configurations, I need to navigate to that specific repository first, then I can invite him as a guest from the project settings.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see we're already on the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project page (Tab 0 shows this URL). To invite Vinta as a guest, I need to access the project settings where member management is typically located. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 395.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see we're currently on the "General · Settings" page for the dotfiles repository. To invite Vinta as a guest, I need to navigate to the "Members" section where I can add new members to the project. I can see a "Members" link in the settings sidebar with bid 407.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the "Members · Byte Blaze / dotfiles · GitLab" page (as shown in the active tab title). The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" tab panel is active, with a search box for selecting members (bid 490), a role selection dropdown set to "Guest" (bid 498), and an "Add to project" button (bid 512) that is currently disabled.

Since I need to invite Vinta as a guest, I should first search for Vinta in the member search box, then ensure the role is set to Guest, and finally click the "Add to project" button once it becomes enabled.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "Vinta" into the member search box (bid 490). The accessibility tree shows that there's a search result available for "Vinta Chen @vinta" (bid 763), and the system even indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it." I need to select Vinta from the search results to proceed with the invitation.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "Vinta" and pressing Enter, the system has successfully found "Vinta Chen @vinta" as indicated in the status area. The role is already set to "Guest" by default, and now the "Add to project" button should be enabled since we have selected a valid user. I need to click the "Add to project" button to complete the invitation process.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see from the accessibility tree that Vinta Chen (@vinta) has already been added as a guest to the project. The status message "Users were successfully added." appears at the top, and Vinta is listed in the "Existing members and groups" section with "Guest" role and "Given access just now." This indicates that my previous action to invite Vinta was successful.

Since the goal was to invite Vinta as a guest to check the dotfile configurations, and he has already been successfully added with the Guest role, the task is complete. I should inform the user that Vinta has been invited.
