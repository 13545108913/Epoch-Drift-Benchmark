## Intent

Follow ['convexegg', 'yjlou'] on Gitlab

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to follow specific users on GitLab, which is a site navigation task that involves modifying the user's following list (content modification). The agent's action history shows it successfully navigated to both user profiles but could not find a follow button, leading it to report the task as infeasible. The final state confirms the agent reached the profiles but did not perform the follow action due to the absence of the button. Since the task requires actually following the users and the agent did not achieve this, the execution is unsuccessful.

Status: failure

## Final Response

===============Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow users 'convexegg' and 'yjlou', I need to navigate to a search or user discovery feature. I can see there's a search box in the navigation with the description "Search or jump to…" which should allow me to search for users.

The search box has bid 142 according to the accessibility tree. I'll use this to search for the first user 'convexegg'.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that I'm already on a search results page for "convexegg" with the search box showing "convexegg" as the current value. The search results show "Users 1" in the results list, which means there is one user matching "convexegg". I should click on the "Users 1" link to view the user search results and then follow the user from there.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that I'm already on the user search results page for "convexegg". The accessibility tree shows a user result with a link to "Convex Eggtart @convexegg" (bid 279). Since I need to follow this user, I should click on this user link to navigate to their profile page where I can find the follow button.
===============Looking at the current page state, I'm now on the user profile page for "convexegg" (as indicated by the URL http://172.26.116.102:8080/convexegg). I can see the user's profile information including their username "@convexegg". To follow this user, I need to find and click a "Follow" button on their profile page. However, I don't see a follow button in the current accessibility tree. This might mean the follow functionality is not available on this page, or I need to look for it in a different section of the profile.

Let me first check if there's a follow button by examining the current page structure more carefully. Since I don't see it in the main content, I should look for user action buttons that might be near the profile header or in the user interaction area.
===============Looking at the current page, I'm on the user profile page for "convexegg" but I don't see a follow button in the accessibility tree. This suggests that either:

1. The follow functionality might not be available on this GitLab instance
2. The follow button might be located in a different part of the interface that's not visible in the current view
3. I might need to be logged in with appropriate permissions to follow users

Since I've successfully navigated to the convexegg profile but can't find a follow button, and I need to also follow 'yjlou', I should try searching for 'yjlou' next to see if the follow functionality is available on their profile page.
===============Looking at the error message, I see that the search box with bid '142' is actually a dropdown div element, not a standard input field. This means I can't use the fill action directly on it. Instead, I need to interact with the actual search input field within this dropdown.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a searchbox element with the description "Search or jump to…" that has bid 143 and is focused. This appears to be the actual input field I should use for searching.

Let me use this searchbox to search for 'yjlou':
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the search box (bid 143) already has "yjlou" as its value (shown as "StaticText 'yjlou'"), which means my previous fill action was successful. Now I need to execute the search by pressing Enter to see the search results for 'yjlou'.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the search results page for "yjlou" with "Users 1" showing in the results list (bid 268). This indicates there is one user matching "yjlou". To follow this user, I need to first navigate to their profile page by clicking on the "Users 1" link, then look for a follow button on their profile page.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the search results page for "yjlou" with "Users 1" showing. The accessibility tree shows a user result with a link to "yjlou @yjlou" (bid 279). Since I need to follow this user, I should click on this user link to navigate to their profile page where I can look for a follow button, similar to what I did with convexegg.
===============Looking at the current situation, I've successfully navigated to both 'convexegg' and 'yjlou' user profile pages, but I haven't been able to find a follow button on either profile. This suggests that either:

1. The GitLab instance doesn't have a user following feature enabled
2. The follow functionality might be located in a different part of the interface that's not visible in the current view
3. I might need different permissions or to be logged in to follow users

Since I've exhausted the direct approach of searching for users and navigating to their profiles, and I can't find any follow buttons, I should report this as infeasible and explain the situation to the user.
