The final state of the webpage confirms that the LICENSE file has been successfully created with the MIT license content. Therefore, the task is successfully completed.

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "byteblaze/dotfiles" project and navigate to it so I can change its LICENSE to MIT.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the "byteblaze/dotfiles" project is listed with a link element that has bid '747'. The project appears as "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" in the list. I should click on this link to navigate to the project page where I can access and modify the LICENSE file.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project page. The accessibility tree shows this is the project repository view with files listed. I need to find and modify the LICENSE file.

From the file listing in the table, I don't see a LICENSE file currently present. However, I notice there's a navigation section with a link to "Add license" (bid '575') which would be the appropriate way to add a MIT license to this repository.

Since there's no existing LICENSE file, I should click the "Add license" link to create one with MIT license content.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New file" page for the dotfiles repository, specifically set up to create a LICENSE file. The URL shows we're on the new file creation page with the filename pre-filled as "LICENSE" and commit message as "Add LICENSE".

I notice there's a button labeled "Apply a license template" (bid '497') which is exactly what I need to change the license to MIT. This button will allow me to select from various license templates, including MIT.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Apply a license template" dropdown is already expanded (expanded=True) and I can see the list of available licenses. The MIT License option is visible in the list with bid '534'. Since the dropdown is already open, I should simply click on the MIT License option to select it and populate the file content with the MIT license template.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the MIT License template has been successfully applied to the LICENSE file. The accessibility tree shows the MIT License content is now displayed in the editor, and there's a "Template applied" message visible. The commit message is already set to "Add LICENSE" and the target branch is set to "master".

The next step is to commit these changes to add the MIT license to the repository. I can see the "Commit changes" button with bid '669' is available. I should click this button to finalize the addition of the MIT license.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the LICENSE file has already been successfully created with the MIT license. The accessibility tree shows "The file has been successfully created." message and displays the full MIT license content. The goal to make the LICENSE of byteblaze/dotfiles use the MIT license has been accomplished.

Since the task is complete, I should notify the user that the license has been successfully changed to MIT.
