===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard in the Projects section. To create a new repository called "awesome_llm_reading", I need to click on the "New project" link that's visible in the accessibility tree.

The "New project" link has bid 223 according to the accessibility tree, so I'll click on that to navigate to the project creation page.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page in GitLab (Tab 0). The accessibility tree shows I'm on the project creation form with various input fields available. Since I need to create a repository called "awesome_llm_reading", I should:

1. Fill in the "Project name" field with "awesome_llm_reading"
2. The form will automatically populate the "Project slug" field
3. Keep the repository empty (don't initialize with README since the goal specifies an empty repository)
4. Click "Create project"

The "Project name" textbox has bid 259 and is currently focused, so I can directly fill it with the repository name.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Project name" field (bid 259) already has the value "awesome_llm_reading" filled in, as shown in the accessibility tree. The goal is to create an empty repository, so I should ensure the "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox remains unchecked (which it currently is), and then click the "Create project" button to complete the repository creation.

The "Create project" button has bid 310, so I'll click that to finalize the repository setup.
