The agent's action history shows it navigated to the new issue page and then clicked on the Issues tab, revealing that an issue with the exact same title already exists. The agent correctly identified this and informed the user, suggesting to open the existing issue instead of creating a duplicate. Since this is a site navigation task (navigating to open an issue), and the agent successfully determined that the issue already exists and communicated this to the user, the task is successful in terms of navigation and avoiding redundancy.", "status": "success"}}
