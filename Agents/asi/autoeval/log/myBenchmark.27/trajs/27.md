## Intent

Show me the command to clone Super_Awesome_Robot with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to obtain the command to clone a specific project ("Super_Awesome_Robot") with SSH, which is an information-seeking task. The agent attempted to search for the project but encountered an issue where no search results appeared, leading it to report the task as infeasible. Since the agent did not provide the requested information (the clone command) and instead indicated failure due to inability to find the project, the task is unsuccessful.

Status: failure

## Final Response

===============Looking at the current page, I can see a GitLab dashboard showing various projects, but I don't see "Super_Awesome_Robot" in the listed projects. To find the SSH clone command for this specific project, I need to first locate the project in the GitLab interface. Since it's not visible on the current page, I should search for it using the search functionality.

The accessibility tree shows a search box with bid 142 that can be used to search for projects. I'll use this to search for "Super_Awesome_Robot" and then navigate to its project page where I can find the SSH clone command.
===============Looking at the current state, I've just searched for "Super_Awesome_Robot" in the search box. Now I need to wait for the search results to load and then navigate to the project page to find the SSH clone command. Let me wait a moment for the search results to appear.
===============Looking at the current state, I've searched for "Super_Awesome_Robot" but I don't see any search results in the accessibility tree yet. The search box (bid 142) is focused, but I need to actually execute the search by pressing Enter to trigger the search results. Let me press Enter to complete the search.
===============Looking at the current state, I've pressed Enter to execute the search for "Super_Awesome_Robot" but I don't see the search results in the accessibility tree yet. I should wait for the search results to load before proceeding. Once the results appear, I'll need to locate the Super_Awesome_Robot project in the search results and click on it to navigate to its project page where I can find the SSH clone command.
===============Looking at the current situation, I've searched for "Super_Awesome_Robot" and pressed Enter, but I still don't see the search results in the accessibility tree. The search should have been executed, but the results aren't visible in the current tree structure. I need to wait a bit longer for the search results to fully load and appear in the DOM, then I can look for the Super_Awesome_Robot project link to click on.
===============Looking at the current situation, I've searched for "Super_Awesome_Robot" and waited for results, but the accessibility tree still doesn't show any search results. The search may have returned no results, or there might be an issue with the search functionality. Since I can't see the project in the search results, I should try a different approach. Let me check if there are any visible project links in the current view that might lead me to the project, or I could try navigating directly to the project URL if I can construct it. However, since I don't have enough information to construct the URL, I'll report that I'm unable to find the project through search.
