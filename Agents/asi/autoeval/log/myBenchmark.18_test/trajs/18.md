Thoughts: The user's intent is to open their latest updated issue with the keyword "better" in the title and check if it is closed. The agent's action history shows it searched for and opened an issue with the keyword "better", then checked the issue status and correctly identified it as open. The final state of the webpage confirms the issue "Better sharing solution (#10)" is open. The bot's response accurately reports the issue is open, fulfilling the information-seeking task by providing the requested status information.

Status: success

## Final Response "The issue 'Better sharing solution (#10

===============
===============
===============
===============Looking at the error message, the previous action `check_issue_status_and_notify()` failed because it couldn't find an element with the text "Status:" within the timeout period. This suggests that either:

1. The issue page didn't load properly
2. The status element has different text/location than expected
3. We're not actually on an issue page yet

From the current accessibility tree, I can see we're still on the project details page (URL: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/empathy-prompts`), not on an issue page. The previous actions show we searched for issues with "better" and clicked something (bid '453'), but it seems we haven't successfully navigated to an issue page yet.

I need to navigate to the issues section first, then find and open the specific issue with "better" in its title. Let me click on the "Issues" link in the project navigation.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there are two issues with "better" in their titles:
- "Better sharing solution" (issue #10, updated 21 hours ago)
- "Better initial load experience" (issue #8, updated 21 hours ago)

Since both were updated 21 hours ago, I need to open the most recently updated one. Looking at the issue numbers, #10 appears first in the list which might indicate it's more recent. Let me click on the "Better sharing solution" issue link to open it and check its status.
===============Looking at the current accessibility tree, I can see we're now on the issue page for "Better sharing solution (#10)". The page shows the issue details including the status indicator which says "Open" (visible in the navigation section around line 426-427). Since the goal is to check if this issue is closed, and I can clearly see it says "Open" in the status, I can directly report this to the user without needing to search for a specific status element.
