## Intent

List the name of the top 3 contributors to prime/design repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is an information-seeking task: to list the names of the top 3 contributors to the prime/design repo, ranked by number of commits. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the correct page and then sent a message to the user with the requested information. However, the bot's response to the user is incomplete—it only lists the first contributor fully ("Shawn Allen (95 commits") and cuts off the rest. The final state of the webpage confirms the top 3 contributors are available, but the bot failed to fully communicate all three in its response. Since the bot's response must contain the complete requested information for an information-seeking task, this is a failure.

Status: failure

## Final Response "The top 3 contributors to the prime/design repo by number of commits are: 1. Shawn Allen (95 commits

===============Looking at the current page, I can see the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find the "prime/design" repository and then navigate to its contributors page to get the top 3 contributors by commit count.

I can see the "Primer / design" project in the list (bid 354). I should click on this link to navigate to the project page first, then find the contributors statistics from there.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Primer/design project page. I need to navigate to the contributors statistics to see the top contributors by commit count. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Repository" link (bid 254) in the sidebar. I should click on that first to access repository-related options, then look for contributors statistics.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the repository page for the "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" branch. I need to navigate to the contributors statistics page to see the top contributors by commit count. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Contributors" link (bid 272) in the repository submenu. This should take me to the contributors statistics page where I can see the commit counts.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Contributors page for the Primer/design repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their commit counts, ranked from highest to lowest. I can see the top 3 contributors are:

1. Shawn Allen - 95 commits
2. Inayaili León - 77 commits
3. Aurora Pleguezuelo - 66 commits

Since I have the information requested, I should send it to the user.
