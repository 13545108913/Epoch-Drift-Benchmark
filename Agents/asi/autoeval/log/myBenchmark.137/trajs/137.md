## Intent

Create a new public project "awesome-llms" and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to create a new public project named "awesome-llms" and add three members: primer, convexegg, and abishek. The action history shows that the agent filled in the project name and clicked to create it, then began adding members by searching for "primer", setting the role to "Developer", and clicking "Add to project". However, the final state indicates that only "primer" has been added so far, and the agent acknowledges that the other two members still need to be added. Since the task requires adding all three members and the agent has not completed this, the execution is incomplete and thus unsuccessful.

Status: failure

## Final Response

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To create a new public project called "awesome-llms" and add members, I need to first navigate to the new project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link with URL '/projects/new' that should take me to the project creation form.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0). The page shows a form with fields for creating a new project. I need to:

1. Fill in the project name as "awesome-llms"
2. Set the visibility level to "Public"
3. Click "Create project" to create it
4. Then navigate to member settings to add the users

The project name field is focused and has bid 259. I'll start by filling in the project name.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the project name field (bid 259) already has the value "awesome-llms" filled in. Now I need to set the project visibility to "Public" as specified in the goal. I can see there are three radio buttons for visibility levels:

- Private (currently checked)
- Internal
- Public

The "Public" radio button has bid 296. I need to click this to make the project public.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The project name "awesome-llms" is already filled in the textbox (bid 259)
2. The "Public" visibility radio button (bid 296) is already checked (focused and checked='true')
3. The form appears to be ready for submission

Since both the project name and public visibility are already set correctly, I can now proceed to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button, which has bid 310. After the project is created, I'll need to navigate to the member settings to add the specified users (primer, convexegg, abishek).
===============Looking at the current page, I can see the project "awesome-llms" has been successfully created (as indicated by the success message "Project 'awesome-llms' was successfully created."). Now I need to add the members primer, convexegg, and abishek to this project. To do this, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Settings" link with bid 362 that should take me to the project settings page where I can manage members.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "General Settings" page for the awesome-llms project. To add members, I need to navigate to the "Members" section. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Members" link in the settings sidebar with bid 375. This should take me to the member management page where I can add the users primer, convexegg, and abishek.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Members" page for the awesome-llms project. The page shows:

1. An "Invite member" section with:
- A search box for "Select members to invite" (bid 452)
- A role dropdown (bid 460) currently set to "Guest"
- An "Add to project" button (bid 474) that is currently disabled

2. An "Existing members and groups" section showing only the current user (byteblaze)

I need to add three members: primer, convexegg, and abishek. I'll start by searching for and adding the first user "primer" with an appropriate role (I'll use "Developer" as a reasonable default since no specific role was specified in the goal).
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled "primer" into the member search box (bid 452). The accessibility tree shows that there's a dropdown with an option for "Primer @primer" (bid 569) that has appeared as a search result. I need to select this user from the dropdown to enable the "Add to project" button.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "primer" and pressing Enter, the user "Primer" has been successfully selected (as indicated by the status message showing "Primer @primer"). The "Add to project" button should now be enabled. I need to set an appropriate role for this user before adding them. The role dropdown (bid 460) is currently set to "Guest", but I should set it to a more appropriate role like "Developer" since no specific role was specified in the goal.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. I've successfully searched for and selected "primer" as a member to add
2. I've set the role to "Developer"
3. The "Add to project" button (bid 474) should now be enabled and ready to add the first member

Now I need to click the "Add to project" button to actually add primer as a member to the awesome-llms project. After this, I'll need to repeat the process for the other two users (convexegg and abishek).
