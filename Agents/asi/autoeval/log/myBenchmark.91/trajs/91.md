## Intent

Invite yjlou as collaborator to solarized-prism-theme

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to invite "yjlou" as a collaborator to "solarized-prism-theme," which is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent performed a series of steps: clicking elements (likely to navigate to the correct page or section), filling a search field with "yjlou," pressing Enter to select the user, and finally clicking the "Add to project" button (bid 512). The final state description confirms that "yjlou" was successfully selected and the "Add to project" button was enabled and clicked. Since the task is content modification, I only need to examine the action history and final state, which indicate the invitation process was completed as intended.

Status: success

===============Looking at the current page, I can see the list of projects and I need to navigate to the "solarized-prism-theme" project to invite yjlou as a collaborator. I can see the project listed in the accessibility tree with the link bid 799.

I should click on the "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" link to navigate to that project's page, where I can then find the settings to add collaborators.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the solarized-prism-theme project page (as indicated by the URL and page title). To invite yjlou as a collaborator, I need to access the project settings where member management is typically located. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 395.

I should click on the Settings link to access the project settings page where I can manage collaborators.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already in the Settings section (General settings page) of the solarized-prism-theme project. To invite yjlou as a collaborator, I need to navigate to the Members section where I can add new project members. I can see a "Members" link in the settings sidebar with bid 407.

I should click on the Members link to access the member management page where I can add collaborators.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the solarized-prism-theme project (as indicated by the URL and the "Project members" heading). The page shows an "Invite member" section where I can search for users to invite. I need to:

1. Search for "yjlou" in the "Select members to invite" search box (bid 490)
2. Select the appropriate role permission (currently set to "Guest")
3. Click the "Add to project" button

The "Add to project" button is currently disabled (bid 512), which means I need to first search for and select yjlou to enable it. I'll start by filling the search box with "yjlou".
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after filling "yjlou" in the search box (bid 490), the accessibility tree shows that there's a search result available for "yjlou @yjlou" (bid 646) with a status message indicating "One result is available, press enter to select it." The "Add to project" button is still disabled, which means I need to actually select the user from the search results to enable the button.

I should press Enter to select the suggested user "yjlou" from the search results.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter to select "yjlou" from the search results, the user should now be selected. The "Add to project" button (bid 512) should now be enabled since we have a valid user selected. I can verify this from the accessibility tree which shows the user "yjlou @yjlou" is now available in the status area.

Now I need to click the "Add to project" button to complete the invitation process.
