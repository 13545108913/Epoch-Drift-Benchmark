===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard. To set the homepage URL in my GitLab profile, I need to navigate to my user profile settings. I can see there's a link to my profile in the top navigation - it's the link with my username "byteblaze" (bid 186). Clicking this should take me to my profile page where I can access settings.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking the profile link (bid 186), a dropdown menu appeared with options including "Profile" and "Settings". To set the homepage URL, I need to access the profile settings where I can edit my profile information. The "Settings" link (bid 202) in the dropdown menu should take me to the profile settings page where I can modify my homepage URL.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the User Settings page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/profile) and I can see the form for editing profile information. The "Website url" field (bid 481) is visible in the form with its current value set to "www.byteblaze.com". To set the homepage URL to "byteblaze.github.io", I need to update this field.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that we're already on the User Settings page and the "Website url" field (bid 481) has been successfully filled with "byteblaze.github.io". The next step is to save these changes by clicking the "Update profile settings" button, which has bid 512 in the accessibility tree.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Website url" field has already been updated to "byteblaze.github.io" and the changes have been saved (as indicated by the success message "Profile was successfully updated" in the accessibility tree). The goal has been accomplished - the homepage URL on the GitLab profile has been set to byteblaze.github.io.
