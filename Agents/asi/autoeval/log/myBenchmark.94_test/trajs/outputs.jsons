{"id": 94, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to invite Koushik to the repo as a guest so he can check the dotfile configurations. The action history shows the agent navigated to the member invitation page, clicked relevant elements, and then sent a message stating that Koushik is already a guest member. The final state of the webpage confirms that Koushik is already listed as a guest member, so no further action is needed. The bot's response correctly informs the user of the existing access, fulfilling the information-seeking aspect of the task.", "status": "success"}}
