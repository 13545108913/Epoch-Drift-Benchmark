{"id": 91, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to invite \"yjlou\" as a collaborator to the project \"solarized-prism-theme,\" which is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent performed `navigate_to_project_members('799', '395', '407')`, which appears to be navigating to a project members page, but there is no subsequent action to actually invite the user \"yjlou.\" The final state of the webpage is empty, indicating no change or confirmation of the invitation. Since the task requires modifying the content (adding a collaborator) and the agent did not perform the necessary action to invite the user, the task is not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
