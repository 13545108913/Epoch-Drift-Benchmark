The action history shows the agent filling in the title, setting the assignee, and setting the due date. The final state confirms the issue was created with all requested specifications: title "add support for oh-my-zsh", assigned to Abishek, and due date July 18, 2033. Therefore, the task is successfully completed.

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to create an issue in the "dotfiles" repo. I can see the "dotfiles" project listed in the project list with the heading "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" and a link to the project.

The first step is to navigate to the dotfiles project page, where I can then create a new issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the dotfiles project page. I need to create an issue in this repository. I can see in the accessibility tree that there's an "Issues 0" link with bid 283, which shows there are currently 0 issues in this project. This is the link I need to click to navigate to the issues section where I can create a new issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Issues page for the dotfiles repository. The accessibility tree shows a "New issue" link with bid 476, which is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new issue with the specified title, assignee, and due date.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Issue" page for the dotfiles repository. The accessibility tree shows:

1. A title textbox (bid 478) that's focused and required
2. An assignee button (bid 571) currently showing "Unassigned"
3. A due date textbox (bid 687) labeled "Select due date"
4. A "Submit issue" button (bid 693) that's currently disabled

I need to:
1. Fill in the title with "add support for oh-my-zsh"
2. Assign the issue to Abishek
3. Set the due date to July 18, 2033

Let me start by filling in the title field, which will likely enable the submit button.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the title has been filled with "add support for oh-my-zsh". Now I need to assign the issue to Abishek. The assignee section shows a button with bid 571 that currently says "Unassigned". I need to click this button to open the assignee selection dropdown where I can search for and select Abishek.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the assignee dropdown is now open and expanded. The accessibility tree shows a search box (bid 580) that's focused, and a list of assignee options including "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" (bid 706). I need to select Abishek from this list to assign the issue to him.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the issue has been assigned to Abishek S. Now I need to set the due date to July 18, 2033. The due date field is a textbox with bid 687 labeled "Select due date". I need to fill this field with the appropriate date format that GitLab expects, which is typically YYYY-MM-DD format.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the title has been set to "add support for oh-my-zsh", the issue has been assigned to Abishek S, and the due date has been filled with "2033-07-18". All the required fields have been completed according to the goal. Now I need to submit the issue by clicking the "Submit issue" button.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see we're on an existing issue page (issue #1) with the title "add support for oh-my-zsh" that already has Abishek assigned and the due date set to July 18, 2033. This means the issue creation was successful and we've been redirected to the created issue page. All the requirements from the goal have been accomplished:

1. ✅ Issue created with title "add support for oh-my-zsh"
2. ✅ Issue assigned to Abishek
3. ✅ Due date set to July 18, 2033

The task is complete, so I should notify the user that the issue has been successfully created with all the requested specifications.
