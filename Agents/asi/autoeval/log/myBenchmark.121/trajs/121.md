## Intent

Create an issue in a11yproject repo with title "401 bad gateway". Assign the issue to Roshanjossey. Set due date to be the end of 2030

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to create an issue with specific details (title, assignee, due date). The action history shows the agent filled the title and attempted to set the due date, but the final state indicates the year 2030 was not visible in the dropdown, and the agent planned to scroll but did not execute it. Since the due date was not successfully set (no scroll action was performed to make 2030 visible and clickable), the content modification task is incomplete. Therefore, the task fails.

Status: failure

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. I need to create an issue in the "a11yproject" repository. I can see "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" in the project list with ID 465. I should click on that project link to navigate to the a11yproject repository where I can then create an issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the a11yproject.com project page in GitLab. To create an issue, I need to navigate to the Issues section. I can see there's an "Issues 40" link in the navigation menu with bid 282, which shows there are currently 40 issues in this project. Clicking this link will take me to the issues page where I can create a new issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the Issues page for the a11yproject.com repository. I can see a "New issue" link with bid 491. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new issue with the title "401 bad gateway", assign it to Roshanjossey, and set the due date to the end of 2030.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Issue" page for the a11yproject.com repository. The form is already loaded with the necessary fields:

1. Title field (bid 478) - I need to fill this with "401 bad gateway"
2. Assignee field (bid 571) - I need to assign to Roshanjossey
3. Due date field (bid 687) - I need to set to the end of 2030

The "Submit issue" button is currently disabled (bid 693), which means I need to fill in the required fields first. Let me start by filling in the title field.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title field has been successfully filled with "401 bad gateway"
2. The assignee field shows "Unassigned" (bid 571) - I need to assign this to Roshanjossey
3. The due date field (bid 687) is empty - I need to set it to the end of 2030

The next step is to assign the issue to Roshanjossey. I need to click on the assignee field to open the assignment dropdown and then search for and select Roshanjossey.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title field has been filled with "401 bad gateway"
2. The assignee dropdown is now open (expanded=True) showing a search box (bid 580) and a list of users
3. I can see "Roshan Jossy @Roshanjossey" in the user list (bid 711)

Since the assignee dropdown is open and I can see Roshanjossey in the list, I need to click on their entry to assign them to the issue.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title field has been successfully filled with "401 bad gateway"
2. The assignee field now shows "Roshan Jossy" (bid 571), which means Roshanjossey has been successfully assigned
3. The due date field (bid 687) is still empty - I need to set it to the end of 2030

The next step is to set the due date. I need to click on the due date field to open the date picker and then select or enter the date for the end of 2030 (which would be December 31, 2030).
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title field has been filled with "401 bad gateway"
2. The assignee has been successfully set to "Roshan Jossy"
3. The due date field has been clicked and a date picker is now visible
4. The date picker shows November 2025 with various date selection options

To set the due date to the end of 2030, I need to:
- First change the year from 2025 to 2030 using the year dropdown (bid 776)
- Then change the month to December using the month dropdown (bid 762)
- Finally select December 31, 2030

Let me start by opening the year dropdown to change to 2030.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The year dropdown (bid 776) has been clicked and is now expanded, showing a list of years from 2015 to 2035
2. I need to select "2030" from this dropdown to set the year to 2030
3. The option for 2030 has bid 792 in the dropdown list

I need to click on the 2030 option to select it as the target year.
===============Looking at the error, the year dropdown option for 2030 (bid 792) is not currently visible in the viewport, which is causing the timeout when trying to click it. The date picker likely needs to be scrolled to make the 2030 option visible. Since the year dropdown is already open and showing options from 2015-2035, I should scroll within the dropdown to bring the 2030 option into view.

I can use the scroll action to scroll down in the date picker area to make the 2030 option visible.
