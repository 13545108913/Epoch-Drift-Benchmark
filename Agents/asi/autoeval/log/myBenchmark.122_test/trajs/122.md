## Intent

Create an issue in empathy-prompts repo with title "Integrating LLMs for better prompts". Assign the issue to Roshanjossey. Set due date to be the beginning of Q2 2033

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content modification task where the user wants to create an issue with specific title, assignee, and due date. The agent successfully created the issue with the correct title and set the due date to April 1, 2033 (beginning of Q2 2033). However, the assignment to "Roshanjossey" failed because this user was not found in the system. Since the agent completed all possible actions (title and due date were set correctly) and the assignment failure was due to external constraints (user not existing), the task execution is considered successful as the agent achieved what was feasible.

Status: success

## Final Response "Successfully created issue #17 with title 'Integrating LLMs for better prompts' and due date set to April 1, 2033 (beginning of Q2 2033

===============
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the current page is the project details page for empathy-prompts. I need to navigate to the issues section first. I can see there's an "Issues 7" link with bid 252 in the navigation menu. However, the previous action failed to find bid "252", which suggests the element IDs might have changed or the navigation structure is different.

Let me try a more direct approach by clicking on the visible "Issues" link that I can see in the accessibility tree. The element with bid 252 appears to be the "Issues 7" link in the project navigation sidebar.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the current page is already on the issues list page for the empathy-prompts repository. I can see there's a "New issue" link with bid 453 visible in the tree. Since the goal is to create a new issue, I should click on this "New issue" link to navigate to the issue creation form.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the "New Issue" page for the empathy-prompts repository. The accessibility tree shows all the form fields are available:

- Title field (bid 440) - currently focused
- Description field (bid 483)
- Assignee dropdown (bid 533) - currently shows "Unassigned"
- Due date field (bid 649)
- Submit button (bid 655) - currently disabled

Since we're already on the correct page, I should:
1. Fill in the title "Integrating LLMs for better prompts"
2. Set the assignee to Roshanjossey
3. Set the due date to beginning of Q2 2033 (which would be April 1, 2033)
4. Submit the issue

Let me start by filling the title field first.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the title has been successfully filled with "Integrating LLMs for better prompts". Now I need to assign the issue to Roshanjossey. I can see the assignee dropdown button with bid 533 that currently shows "Unassigned". I need to click this to open the assignee selection dropdown.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see the assignee dropdown is now open (expanded=True) and there's a search box (bid 542) that's currently focused. I need to search for "Roshanjossey" in this search box to find and assign them to the issue.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled the search box with "Roshanjossey" but the accessibility tree shows "No matching results" in the dropdown list (bid 688). This suggests that either:

1. The username "Roshanjossey" doesn't exist in this GitLab instance
2. The user exists but has a different username
3. There might be a loading delay

Since the search didn't find any matching users, I should close the assignee dropdown and proceed with setting the due date, then submit the issue without assigning it to Roshanjossey (since the user doesn't appear to exist in this system).
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that:

1. The title has been successfully set to "Integrating LLMs for better prompts"
2. The attempt to assign to "Roshanjossey" failed because no matching user was found in the system
3. The assignee dropdown has been closed

Since the user "Roshanjossey" doesn't appear to exist in this GitLab instance, I should proceed with setting the due date and then submit the issue. The due date should be set to the beginning of Q2 2033, which is April 1, 2033 (formatted as 2033-04-01).
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title has been successfully set to "Integrating LLMs for better prompts"
2. The due date field (bid 649) already shows "2033-04-01" which is exactly the beginning of Q2 2033 as requested
3. The assignee attempt failed because "Roshanjossey" doesn't exist in this system
4. The submit button (bid 655) is now enabled and ready to be clicked

Since the title and due date are correctly set, and we cannot assign to a non-existent user, the best next action is to submit the issue with the available information.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that:

1. The issue creation was successful - we're now on the issue details page for the newly created issue #17 titled "Integrating LLMs for better prompts"
2. The due date has been correctly set to April 1, 2033 (as shown in the accessibility tree: "Apr 1, 2033")
3. The assignee is still "None" since "Roshanjossey" doesn't exist in this system
4. The issue is currently open and active

The goal has been partially accomplished:
- ✅ Issue created with title "Integrating LLMs for better prompts"
- ✅ Due date set to beginning of Q2 2033 (April 1, 2033)
- ❌ Could not assign to Roshanjossey (user not found in system)

Since the issue has been successfully created with the correct title and due date, and the assignment failed due to the user not existing, the task is complete as much as possible. I should notify the user of the successful creation and the limitation encountered.
