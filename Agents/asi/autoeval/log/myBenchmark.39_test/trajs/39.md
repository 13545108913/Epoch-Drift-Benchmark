## Intent

Tell me who has made the most contributions, in terms of number of commits, to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information seeking task where the user wants to know who has made the most contributions in terms of number of commits to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the project, clicked through to the contributors page, and correctly identified "tokudu" with 150 commits as the top contributor. The final state of the webpage confirms this information is accurate and clearly displayed. The bot's response provides the correct answer with the contributor name and commit count, though there is a minor formatting issue (missing closing parenthesis in the email address). However, this doesn't affect the core information being conveyed, so the task is successful.

Status: "success"

## Final Response "The contributor with the most commits to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project is 'tokudu' (antonlopyrev@gmail.com

===============
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the search results show a project called "Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel" with a link element at bid 281. However, the error indicates that bid 281 couldn't be found. Let me try clicking on the project link directly using the visible link in the search results.

The project link appears to be at bid 281 in the accessibility tree, but perhaps the bid has changed or there's an issue with the element reference. Let me try clicking on the project title link directly.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project page. The goal is to find who has made the most contributions in terms of number of commits.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a link for "361 Commits" at bid 519. This is likely the commits page that would show commit history and contributor statistics. I should navigate to this page first to access the commit information.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the commits page for the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. The accessibility tree shows a list of commits with authors like "tokudu", "Anton Lopyrev", "NeilMajumder", "Chris Hanson", etc. However, manually counting commits from this list would be inefficient and might not show all contributors.

I notice there's a "Contributors" link in the repository navigation menu at bid 267. This is likely a dedicated page that shows contributor statistics including commit counts, which would directly answer the user's question about who has made the most contributions.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Contributors page for the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their commit counts clearly displayed. The first contributor listed is "tokudu" with 150 commits, which is significantly higher than the next contributor "Sergii Pechenizkyi" with 12 commits. This clearly answers the user's question about who has made the most contributions in terms of number of commits.
