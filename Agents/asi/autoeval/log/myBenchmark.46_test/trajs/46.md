## Intent

List the last names of the top 3 contributors to 2019-nCov repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is an information-seeking task: to list the last names of the top 3 contributors to the 2019-nCov repo, ranked by the number of commits. The agent successfully navigated to the Contributors page, where the commit counts are displayed. The top 3 contributors by commits are Louis Lo (286), Stimim Chen (50), and Owen Chu (2). The agent correctly extracted and provided the last names in the requested order (Lo, Chen, Chu). The information is accurate and complete based on the final state of the webpage.

Status: success

## Final Response "The last names of the top 3 contributors to the 2019-nCov repo, ranked by number of commits, are: Lo, Chen, Chu"

===============
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that the search for "2019-nCov" has already been performed and there is one project result showing: "yjlou / 2019-nCov" with a link. The previous action failed because it tried to click on element "281" which doesn't exist in the current accessibility tree. I should click on the actual repository link that's visible in the search results.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a link with the text "yjlou / 2019-nCov" that appears to be the repository link. I'll click on this to navigate to the repository page where I can then find contributor information.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the repository "yjlou / 2019-nCov" is already loaded and I'm currently on its main page. The previous action to click on element '281' doesn't seem to have worked as expected, but I'm already on the correct repository page.

To find the top contributors by number of commits, I need to navigate to the repository's commit history or contributors page. I can see there's a link for "344 Commits" in the navigation area (element [519]), which would show the commit history where I could potentially analyze contributor statistics.

Let me click on the "344 Commits" link to access the commit history page.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the commits page for the 2019-nCov repository (as indicated by the URL and page title). The accessibility tree shows a long list of commits with contributor information, but I need to find the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits.

From the commit history, I can see multiple contributors like "Stimim Chen", "Jakub Czaplicki", "Louis Lo", and "Yung-Chieh Lo" (which appears to be the same person as Louis Lo based on the email address). However, manually counting commits from this list would be inefficient and the page only shows a limited number of commits.

I notice there's a "Contributors" link in the repository navigation (element [267]) that would likely show contributor statistics with commit counts. This would be the most efficient way to get the top contributors ranked by commits.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Contributors page for the 2019-nCov repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their commit counts:

- Louis Lo: 286 commits
- Stimim Chen: 50 commits
- Owen Chu: 2 commits
- weichi: 1 commit
- Jakub Czaplicki: 1 commit

The top 3 contributors by number of commits are clearly displayed. I can now extract the last names and send this information to the user.
