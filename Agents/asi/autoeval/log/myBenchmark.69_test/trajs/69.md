## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Busy.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to set their GitLab status to "Busy," which is a content modification task. The action history shows that the agent performed the action `set_gitlab_status` with parameters including 'Busy'. Since this is a content modification task, I need to examine the action history and the final state of the webpage to determine success. The action was executed, and the final state of the webpage is empty, which may indicate that the status was successfully set without any remaining visible content or error. There is no indication of failure in the action or final state. The bot's response being "None" is irrelevant for content modification tasks.

Status: success
