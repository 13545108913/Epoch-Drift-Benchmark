## Intent

How many commits did Eric and Kilian make to a11yproject on 1/3/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The user wants to know the number of commits made by Eric and Kilian on a specific date. The bot's response directly provides the requested information: Eric made 1 commit and Kilian made 0 commits. The final state of the webpage confirms this information, showing 1 commit by Eric Bailey and no commits by Kilian on January 3, 2023. The bot's actions appear sufficient to navigate to the correct commit history and extract the necessary data.

Status: success

## Final Response "On January 3, 2023, Eric made 1 commit and Kilian made 0 commits to the a11yproject repository."

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see a list of projects including "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" which matches the repository name mentioned in the goal. To find commit information for specific authors on a specific date, I need to navigate to that project's repository page where I can access the commit history and filter by date and author.

The project "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" is listed with a link that should take me to the project page. From there, I can navigate to the repository's commit history.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the a11yproject.com repository page. I need to access the commit history to find commits by Eric and Kilian on 1/3/2023. I can see there's a "Repository" section in the navigation with a link that likely leads to the repository view, and there's also a "History" link visible that should take me directly to the commit history.

The "History" link appears to be at bid 653, which should take me to the commit history page where I can then filter by date and author.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch of the a11yproject.com repository. The page shows commits grouped by date, but all the visible dates are from 2020 (5 years ago), which is much earlier than the target date of January 3, 2023.

To find commits from January 3, 2023, I need to either:
1. Scroll down to load more recent commits
2. Use the search/filter functionality to find commits from that specific date

I can see there's a search box labeled "Filter by commit message" at bid 496, but this filters by commit message content, not by date or author. For date-based filtering, I likely need to scroll to load more recent commits or find a date picker/filter option.

Let me first try scrolling down to see if more recent commits load.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that the commit history only shows commits from 2020 (5 years ago), which is much earlier than the target date of January 3, 2023. The page appears to be showing commits only for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch, which might not contain the commits I'm looking for.

To find commits from January 3, 2023 by Eric and Kilian, I need to:
1. Navigate to the main/default branch's commit history instead of this specific feature branch
2. Look for a way to view all branches or switch to the main branch

I can see there's a button showing "add-color-utility-classes" at bid 473, which likely allows me to switch branches. Let me click on that to access branch selection and choose the main/default branch.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch, but all the visible commits are from 2020. The goal is to find commits from January 3, 2023 by Eric and Kilian, which won't be visible in this older branch.

I need to switch to the main/default branch where recent commits would be located. I can see the branch selector button at bid 473 showing "add-color-utility-classes" with "expanded=True" in the accessibility tree, which suggests the branch dropdown is already open. In the dropdown list, I can see "main" listed at bid 1462. I should click on "main" to switch to that branch and view its commit history.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the main branch's commit history. The page shows commits grouped by date, and I can see dates like "03 Jan, 2023" which matches the target date of January 3, 2023. For January 3, 2023, the page shows "1 commit" and lists Eric Bailey as the author. I don't see any commits by Kilian on this date.

Let me count the commits:
- On January 3, 2023: 1 commit by Eric Bailey
- No commits by Kilian on this date

So Eric made 1 commit and Kilian made 0 commits to a11yproject on January 3, 2023.
