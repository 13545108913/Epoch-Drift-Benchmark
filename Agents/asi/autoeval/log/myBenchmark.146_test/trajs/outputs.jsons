{"id": 146, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to create a private NodeJS repository called \"web_agent_nodejs\" using a template. The action history shows the agent attempted to create from a template, encountered a name conflict (\"web_agent_nodejs\" already taken), tried to modify the name to \"web_agent_nodejs_1\", but the project name field became inaccessible, and a scroll action failed. The final state indicates the form fields are not visible, and the agent's internal reasoning suggests navigating back to reset the form, but no further successful actions are recorded. Since the repository was not created (no confirmation of successful creation in the final state or action history), and the agent did not complete the task, this is a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
