## Intent

List the last names of the top 3 contributors to 2019-nCov repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is an information-seeking task to list the last names of the top 3 contributors to the 2019-nCov repo, ranked by number of commits. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the contributors page, and the final state of the webpage confirms the top 3 contributors are displayed with their names and commit counts, ranked by commits. The agent's response correctly lists the last names (Lo, Chen, Chu) in the order of commit ranking, matching the information in the final state. The actions taken were sufficient to obtain and present the requested information.

Status: success

## Final Response "The last names of the top 3 contributors to the 2019-nCov repo, ranked by number of commits, are: Lo, Chen, Chu"

===============Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "2019-nCov" repository to check its contributors. Since this repository isn't visible in the current project list, I should use the search functionality to find it.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" in the accessibility tree. I'll use this to search for the "2019-nCov" repository.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that I'm already on a search results page for "2019-nCov" and there's one project result shown: "yjlou / 2019-nCov". This appears to be the repository I need to access to find contributor information. The project link is visible in the accessibility tree with the heading "yjlou / 2019-nCov" and a URL pointing to the project page.

I should click on this project link to navigate to the repository page where I can then access contributor statistics.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the 2019-nCov repository page. I need to find the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits. On GitLab, contributor statistics are typically found in the repository section. I can see there's a "Repository" link in the navigation menu with bid '250'. I should click on this to access the repository view where I can then find contributor information.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the repository page for 2019-nCov (the URL shows "/tree/master"). In the repository navigation menu, I can see there's a "Contributors" link with bid '268' that should show the contributor statistics I need. This is exactly what I need to access to find the top contributors ranked by number of commits.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Contributors page for the 2019-nCov repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their names and commit counts. I can see the top contributors are:

1. Louis Lo - 286 commits
2. Stimim Chen - 50 commits
3. Owen Chu - 2 commits

The goal is to list the last names of the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits. From the information displayed, I can extract:
- Lo (from Louis Lo)
- Chen (from Stimim Chen)
- Chu (from Owen Chu)

I now have the information needed to answer the user's question.
