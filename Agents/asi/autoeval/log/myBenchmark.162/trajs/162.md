## Intent

Create an issue in cloud-to-butt repo with title "Let's keep the project alive". Assign the issue to myself. Set due date to be the end of Q1 2033

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content modification task where the user wants to create an issue with specific attributes (title, assignment, due date). The action history shows the agent performed steps to create the issue, fill in the title, set the due date, and assign it. The final state confirms the issue was created with the correct title, assigned to the user (Byte Blaze), and the due date is set to March 31, 2033 (end of Q1 2033). The bot's response also confirms the successful creation, though it cuts off mid-sentence. Since the task is content modification, the final state and action history are sufficient to determine success, and all requirements are met.

Status: success

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "cloud-to-butt" repository first, then navigate to its issues section to create a new issue with the specified title, assign it to myself, and set the due date.

The page shows many projects but I don't see "cloud-to-butt" in the visible list. I should use the search functionality to find this project.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" which would be perfect for finding the cloud-to-butt project.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the search box already has "cloud-to-butt" filled in (value='cloud-to-butt'), and there are search results showing two projects: "Steven Frank / cloud-to-butt" and "Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt". Since I need to create an issue in the cloud-to-butt repo, I should click on the "Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt" project link since that appears to be my own fork of the project.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the cloud-to-butt project page. I need to navigate to the Issues section to create a new issue. I can see in the accessibility tree that there's an "Issues 0" link, which indicates the issues section and shows there are currently 0 issues. This is exactly what I need to click to get to the issues page where I can create a new issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Issues page for the cloud-to-butt repository. The page shows "Issues 0" indicating there are currently no issues, and there's a prominent "New issue" link that I can click to create the issue. This is exactly what I need to accomplish the goal of creating a new issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New Issue" page for the cloud-to-butt repository. The page shows:

1. A "Title" textbox (bid 479) that's currently focused
2. An "Assignee" section with an "Unassigned" button (bid 572) and an "Assign to me" link (bid 587)
3. A "Due date" textbox (bid 688)
4. A "Submit issue" button (bid 694) that's currently disabled

To accomplish the goal, I need to:
1. Fill in the title with "Let's keep the project alive"
2. Assign the issue to myself using the "Assign to me" link
3. Set the due date to the end of Q1 2033 (which would be March 31, 2033)
4. Submit the issue

I'll start by filling in the title field since it's already focused.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title field (bid 479) has already been filled with "Let's keep the project alive" from my previous action
2. I now need to assign the issue to myself using the "Assign to me" link (bid 587)
3. After that, I'll need to set the due date to March 31, 2033 (end of Q1 2033)
4. Finally, I'll submit the issue

The "Assign to me" link is clearly visible in the accessibility tree, so I should click that next to assign the issue to myself.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title has been successfully filled with "Let's keep the project alive"
2. The issue has been assigned to myself (Byte Blaze) as shown in the assignee button
3. Now I need to set the due date to the end of Q1 2033 (March 31, 2033)
4. The due date field is a textbox (bid 688) where I can enter the date

I should now fill the due date field with "2033-03-31" which represents the end of Q1 2033.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The title has been set to "Let's keep the project alive"
2. The issue has been assigned to myself (Byte Blaze)
3. The due date has been set to "2033-03-31" (end of Q1 2033)
4. All required fields are now filled

The "Submit issue" button (bid 694) should now be enabled and ready to be clicked to create the issue. I should click it to complete the goal.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that the issue has been successfully created with the title "Let's keep the project alive (#1)" and is now displayed. The accessibility tree shows:

1. The issue is open and assigned to Byte Blaze (myself)
2. The due date has been set to March 31, 2033 (as shown in the "Due date" section)
3. All the requirements from the goal have been met:
- Issue created with title "Let's keep the project alive"
- Issue assigned to myself
- Due date set to end of Q1 2033 (March 31, 2033)

Since the goal has been fully accomplished and the issue is successfully created with all the specified requirements, I should notify the user that the task is complete.
