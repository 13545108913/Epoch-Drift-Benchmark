## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got more than 100 stars?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task where the user wants the full names of repositories where they contributed and which have more than 100 stars. The agent has scrolled to the bottom and reviewed all visible repositories, finding none with more than 100 stars. The agent's response correctly states that no repositories meet the criteria and provides the highest star counts observed. This is a sufficient and accurate response for the given information.

Status: success

## Final Response "Based on the current view of your GitLab projects, none of your repositories have more than 100 stars. The highest star count among your repositories is 21 stars for 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com' and 'Primer / design'."

===============
===============Looking at the current page, I can see a list of repositories with their star counts (shown as numbers next to star icons). I need to identify which repositories have more than 100 stars and where I have a contributor role.

From the accessibility tree, I can see several repositories with their star counts:
- "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" has 2 stars
- "Primer / design" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website" has 2 stars
- "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting" has 1 star
- "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / timeit" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" has 0 stars

None of these repositories have more than 100 stars. Since I've already scrolled to the bottom and can see all 14 projects listed, there are no repositories that meet the criteria of having more than 100 stars.
