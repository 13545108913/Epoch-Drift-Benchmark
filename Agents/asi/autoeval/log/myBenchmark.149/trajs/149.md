## Intent

Add the following users to repo kkroening/ffmpeg-python as maintainer: ['yjlou', 'a11yproject']

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to add specific users as maintainers to a repository, which is a content modification task. The agent's action history shows attempts to search for the users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject', but the searches returned no results, and the agent reported the task as infeasible. The final state confirms that the users were not found and thus not added. Since the agent correctly identified that the users do not exist in the system and reported this, the task is appropriately handled as infeasible, which constitutes a success in terms of correctly assessing and communicating the situation.

Status: success

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The goal is to add users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' as maintainers to the repo 'kkroening/ffmpeg-python'.

First, I need to find and navigate to the specific repository. I can see there's a search box available (bid 142) that I can use to search for the project. Let me search for the 'kkroening/ffmpeg-python' repository.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "kkroening/ffmpeg-python" has already been executed but returned no results. The page shows "We couldn't find any results matching kkroening/ffmpeg-python". This suggests the repository might not exist in this GitLab instance or I need to adjust my search approach.

Let me try a broader search by just searching for "ffmpeg-python" to see if the repository exists under a different namespace or if I need to modify my search strategy.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that my previous search for "kkroening/ffmpeg-python" didn't yield results, but there's actually a search result showing "Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python" which appears to be the repository I'm looking for. The accessibility tree shows a link to this repository with bid 284. Instead of continuing to search, I should click on this existing search result to navigate to the repository page where I can then manage members and add the specified users as maintainers.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python" repository page. The goal is to add users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' as maintainers. To do this, I need to navigate to the member management settings where I can add users with specific roles.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Members" link with bid 354 in the sidebar. This is likely where I need to go to manage project members and add new users with maintainer roles.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "Members" page for the ffmpeg-python repository. The accessibility tree shows a search box with bid 423 labeled "Find existing members by name" and I can see the current member list showing Karl Kroening as a maintainer.

To add new users as maintainers, I need to:
1. Use the search box to find each user
2. Select them and assign the "Maintainer" role
3. Add them to the project

I'll start by searching for the first user 'yjlou' using the search functionality.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled the search box with 'yjlou' (the accessibility tree shows "value='yjlou'"). Now I need to either press Enter to execute the search or click the search button to find this user. Since the search box is already focused and filled, I should press Enter to trigger the search and see if the user appears in the results.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already searched for 'yjlou' and the search has been executed (the accessibility tree shows the search box with value='yjlou'). Now I need to check if the user appears in the search results and add them as a maintainer.

The accessibility tree shows an empty list (bid 448) after the search, which suggests that either the user wasn't found or the results aren't being displayed properly. Let me try searching for the second user 'a11yproject' to see if that user exists in the system.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled the search box with 'a11yproject' but haven't executed the search yet. The accessibility tree shows the search box has value='a11yproject' and is focused, but I need to actually perform the search to see if this user exists in the system. I should press Enter to execute the search for 'a11yproject'.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've searched for both 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' users but neither appears to have been found in the system (the member list remains empty). The search functionality is working, but these specific users don't seem to exist in this GitLab instance.

Since I cannot find these users to add them as maintainers, I should report this as infeasible to the user, explaining that the users were not found in the system.
