## Intent

Show me the command to clone metaseq with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task where the user wants the SSH clone command for the "metaseq" project. The agent performed a search for "metaseq" and found no matching projects in the GitLab instance. The agent's response clearly states that the project does not exist in this instance and therefore cannot provide the SSH clone command. This is an appropriate and truthful response for an information-seeking task when the requested information is not available.

Status: success

## Final Response "The search for 'metaseq' returned no results in this GitLab instance. There are no projects matching that name, so I cannot provide an SSH clone command. You may need to check if the project exists in this GitLab instance or if you have the correct project name."

===============
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search for "metaseq" returned no results - there are 0 projects, 0 issues, 0 merge requests, etc. The page shows "We couldn't find any results matching metaseq". Since the search didn't find any project called "metaseq", I cannot provide the SSH clone command for a project that doesn't exist in this GitLab instance.
