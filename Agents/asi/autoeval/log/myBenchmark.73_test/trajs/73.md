## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Out of Office.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to set their GitLab status to "Out of Office," which is a content modification task. The action history shows that the agent executed `set_gitlab_status` with parameters including 'Out of Office'. However, the final state of the webpage is empty, which suggests that the action may not have been successfully applied or there was no confirmation of the change. Without any visible change in the final state, it is unclear if the modification was completed. For content modification tasks, the final state must reflect the intended change for success. Since the final state is empty, the task is considered a failure.

Status: failure
