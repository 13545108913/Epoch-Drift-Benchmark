Thoughts: This is a content modification task where the user wants to set the homepage URL on their GitLab profile to https://helloworld.xyz. The action history shows the agent updated the URL field and clicked the update button multiple times. The final state confirms the URL field contains the correct value and a success message "Profile was successfully updated" is visible, indicating the modification was applied successfully.

Status: success

## Final Response "The homepage URL has been successfully set to https://helloworld.xyz on your GitLab profile. The profile has been updated."

===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the website URL field is present with bid "481" and it already contains the value "https://helloworld.xyz". The error suggests that the element with bid "481" couldn't be found, but it's clearly visible in the current page structure.

Since the URL is already set to the desired value, I should click the "Update profile settings" button to save the changes. The button has bid "512" according to the accessibility tree.
