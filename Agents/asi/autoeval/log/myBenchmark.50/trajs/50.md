## Intent

Who else have access to my repo prism-theme, show me their usernames

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to find out who else has access to their "prism-theme" repository, specifically requesting their usernames. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the Members page for the repository (solarized-prism-theme, which appears to be the intended repo based on context) and identified two members: the user themselves and another user, Abishek S (@abisubramanya27). The bot's response, however, is incomplete—it starts with "Besides yourself (@byteblaze." but cuts off, failing to provide the full information about the other user. Since this is an information-seeking task, the bot must fully convey the requested information, and the truncated response means the user does not receive the complete answer, leading to a failure.

Status: failure

## Final Response "Besides yourself (@byteblaze

===============Looking at the current page, I can see a list of projects but I don't see "prism-theme" in the visible project list. I need to search for this specific repository first. I can see there's a search box available in the navigation with the description "Search or jump to…" which would be perfect for finding the prism-theme repository.

The search box appears to be at bid 142 based on the accessibility tree structure. I'll use this to search for the prism-theme repository.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search has already been executed for "prism-theme" and there are search results showing. I can see two projects in the results list:

1. "小子欠扁 / solarized-prism-theme" (owned by xiaozi)
2. "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" (owned by byteblaze)

Since the goal is to find who else has access to "my repo prism-theme", I need to click on the Byte Blaze project (which appears to be mine) to access the repository settings where I can view members and their access levels.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme project page. To see who else has access to this repository, I need to navigate to the project settings where member information is typically located. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar navigation with bid 392. This is where I should find member access information.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Settings page for the solarized-prism-theme repository. In the Settings sidebar, I can see a "Members" option at bid 404, which is exactly where I need to go to see who else has access to this repository. This should display the list of users with access and their permission levels.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the solarized-prism-theme repository. The accessibility tree shows there are existing members listed in a section with the heading "Existing members and groups". I can see two members displayed:

1. Abishek S (@abisubramanya27) with Guest role
2. Byte Blaze (@byteblaze) with Maintainer role (which is me)

The goal was to show who else has access to my repo prism-theme, and I can now see that besides myself (@byteblaze), there is one other user (@abisubramanya27) who has Guest access to the repository. I should send this information to the user.
