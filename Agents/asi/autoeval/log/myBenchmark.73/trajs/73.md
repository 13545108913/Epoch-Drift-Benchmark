## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Out of Office.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to set their GitLab status as "Out of Office," which is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent filled the status textbox (bid 400) with "Out of Office" and clicked an element (bid 512), which likely corresponds to saving the changes. The final state of the webpage confirms that the status textbox contains "Out of Office" and indicates that the changes need to be saved by clicking the "Update profile settings" button. Since the agent performed the fill and click actions, and the final state reflects the intended content, the task appears to have been successfully completed.

Status: success

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard. To set my status as "Out of Office", I need to navigate to my user profile settings where the status can be configured. I can see my user profile link in the top navigation - it's the link with my avatar image and username "byteblaze" (bid 186).

I'll click on my profile link to access the user menu and then navigate to the settings where I can set my status.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking on my profile link (bid 186), the user menu has expanded. I can see there's a "Settings" link (bid 202) in the dropdown menu, which is where I need to go to configure my user status. The menu also shows my current status as "Resting due to leg injury" and has an "Edit status" button, but I should navigate to the full settings page to ensure I can properly set the "Out of Office" status.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the User Settings page (Profile section). I can see the "Current status" section with a textbox showing the current status "Resting due to leg injury" (bid 400). To set my status as "Out of Office", I need to update this textbox with the new status message.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the status textbox (bid 400) already contains "Out of Office" as its value, which means the status has been successfully set. Now I need to save these changes by clicking the "Update profile settings" button at the bottom of the form to make the status change permanent.
