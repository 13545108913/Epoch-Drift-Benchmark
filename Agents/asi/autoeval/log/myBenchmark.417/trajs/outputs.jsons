{"id": 417, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent involves multiple steps: navigating to a specific merge request (site navigation), checking if the author responded (information seeking), and then either replying \"Thank you\" or reminding them (content modification). The agent's action history shows it attempted to click an element (\"157\") and waited/scrolled, but ultimately reported it was infeasible due to the accessibility tree not updating, preventing it from seeing or interacting with the merge request content. Since the agent could not even locate or access the specific merge request, it failed at the first critical step (site navigation), making it impossible to proceed with the subsequent information seeking and content modification tasks. The final state confirms the agent was unable to see the page content, and no bot response was provided to the user, further indicating failure.", "status": "failure"}}
