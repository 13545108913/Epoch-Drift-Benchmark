## Intent

Submit a merge request for build time debug branch to be merged into main branch, assign myself as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to submit a merge request for the "debug-build-time" branch to be merged into the "main" branch and assign themselves as the reviewer. The action history shows the agent has selected the source and target branches and clicked the "Compare branches and continue" button (action 10), but the final state indicates the agent is still in the process of creating the merge request and has not yet reached the step to assign a reviewer. Since the task is a content modification (submitting a merge request with a specific reviewer assignment) and the final state does not confirm the merge request was submitted or the reviewer was assigned, the task is incomplete and thus a failure.

Status: failure

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab project page for "primer/design". The goal is to submit a merge request for the "build time debug" branch to be merged into the "main" branch, and assign myself as the reviewer.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge Requests" link in the sidebar with the text "Merge Requests 144". This is likely where I need to go to create a new merge request. The current branch shown is "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs", but I need to navigate to the merge requests section first.

Let me click on the "Merge Requests" link to navigate to the merge requests page where I can create a new merge request.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm already on the Merge Requests page for the primer/design project (as indicated by the URL and page title). The goal is to create a new merge request for the "build time debug" branch to be merged into "main" branch.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "New merge request" link with bid 452. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new merge request.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the "New Merge Request" page for the primer/design project. The goal is to create a merge request from "build time debug" branch to "main" branch and assign myself as reviewer.

From the accessibility tree, I can see:
- Source branch is currently set to "primer/design" with a "Select source branch" button (bid 462)
- Target branch is currently set to "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" (but I need to change this to "main")

I need to first select the correct source branch ("build time debug") and target branch ("main"). Let me start by clicking the "Select source branch" button to choose the source branch.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the source branch dropdown is open (expanded=True) and there's a search box (bid 471) that's currently focused. I can see the branch list includes "debug-build-time" at position 560, which is the branch I need to select for the source branch.

Since the search box is already focused, I can simply type "debug-build-time" to filter the branches and then select it.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "debug-build-time" in the search box (bid 471), and the branch list shows "debug-build-time" as an available option (bid 623). Now I need to select this branch as the source branch by clicking on it.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've successfully selected "debug-build-time" as the source branch. Now I need to change the target branch from "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" to "main". I can see there's a target branch button with bid 505 that I need to click to open the target branch selection dropdown.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the target branch dropdown is now open (expanded=True) with a search box (bid 514) that's focused. I can see in the branch list that "main" is available at position 678. I need to select "main" as the target branch by either searching for it or clicking directly on it. Since the search box is already focused, I'll type "main" to filter the branches and then select it.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled "main" in the target branch search box (bid 514), and the branch list shows "main" as an available option (bid 678). Now I need to select "main" as the target branch by clicking on it.
===============Looking at the error, the element with bid "678" was not found. This suggests that the branch list may have changed after I searched for "main". Let me check the current accessibility tree again - I can see there's a list item with bid 720 that contains a link for "main". This appears to be the correct element to select the main branch.

Let me click on the "main" branch link in the target branch dropdown.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've successfully selected both the source branch ("debug-build-time") and target branch ("main"). Now I need to proceed to the next step of creating the merge request. I can see there's a "Compare branches and continue" button with bid 543 that I should click to proceed to the next step where I can assign myself as a reviewer.
