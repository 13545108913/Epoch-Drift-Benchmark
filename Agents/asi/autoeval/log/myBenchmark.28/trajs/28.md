===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. The user wants to see the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH. Since this is a GitLab instance, I need to find if there's a ChatGPT repository in the project list.

Scanning through the projects, I don't see any project named "ChatGPT" or similar in the current view. The projects shown include things like "a11yproject.com", "a11y-webring.club", "design", and various other repositories, but no ChatGPT-related project.

Since the user specifically asked for the SSH clone command for ChatGPT, and I don't see that repository in the current project list, I should search for it first.

I can see there's a search box available (element with bid 142) that says "Search or jump to…" - this would be the appropriate place to search for the ChatGPT repository.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>I need to search for the ChatGPT repository in this GitLab instance to find its SSH clone command. I can see a search box with bid 142 labeled "Search or jump to…" which is perfect for finding the repository.
===============Looking at the current state, I've clicked on the search box (bid 142) but haven't entered any search terms yet. Since the user wants to find the ChatGPT repository to get its SSH clone command, I now need to type "ChatGPT" into the search box to find the relevant repository.
===============Looking at the current state, I've successfully entered "ChatGPT" into the search box (bid 142). Now I need to execute the search to find the ChatGPT repository. Since this is a search box, I should press Enter to perform the search and see the results.
===============Looking at the current state, I've successfully searched for "ChatGPT" and the search results are now displayed. I can see in the accessibility tree that there's a project called "Convex Eggtart / Chatgpt" (bid 281) which appears to be the ChatGPT repository I'm looking for. To get the SSH clone command, I need to navigate to this project's main page where the clone options are typically available.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the ChatGPT project page in GitLab. The accessibility tree shows various elements including repository information, and I can see there's a "Clone" button/link (bid 493) which is exactly what I need to access to find the SSH clone command. When I click on the Clone button, it should reveal the different clone options including the SSH URL.
===============Looking at the current state after clicking the "Clone" button (bid 493), I can see in the accessibility tree that the clone options are now expanded and visible. I can see there are two clone options listed:

1. "Clone with SSH" with a textbox containing the value 'git@localhost:convexegg/chatgpt.git' (bid 500)
2. "Clone with HTTP" with a textbox containing the value 'http://localhost/convexegg/chatgpt.git' (bid 507)

The user specifically asked for the SSH clone command, which is clearly visible now. The SSH clone URL is 'git@localhost:convexegg/chatgpt.git'. I should send this information to the user since this is exactly what they requested.
