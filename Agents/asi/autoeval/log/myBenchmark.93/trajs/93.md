## Intent

yjlou wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content modification task where the user wants to invite "yjlou" to a repository as a guest. The action history shows the agent performed steps to search for the user, select them, and assign a guest role, with the final state confirming the invitation was successful ("Users were successfully added.") and yjlou is listed as a guest with access granted just now. The bot's response also correctly states the successful invitation. Therefore, the task is successfully completed.

Status: success

## Final Response "Successfully invited yjlou to the dotfiles repository as a guest. The user now has access to check your dotfile configurations."

===============Looking at the goal, I need to invite "yjlou" to the dotfiles repository as a guest. From the accessibility tree, I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed. I need to first navigate to that project page, then find the members/invite section to add yjlou as a guest.

The dotfiles project link has bid "901" according to the accessibility tree. I'll click on that link to navigate to the project page first.
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles). I can see various navigation options including "Settings" which is likely where I need to go to manage members and invitations.

I can see a "Settings" link with bid "395" in the sidebar. This should lead to the project settings where I can manage members and invite yjlou as a guest.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "General · Settings" page for the dotfiles project. I need to navigate to the "Members" section to invite yjlou as a guest. In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Members" link under the Settings section with bid "407". This is exactly what I need to access the member management page where I can invite new members.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Members · Byte Blaze / dotfiles · GitLab" page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles/-/project_members). The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" tab is available with a search box for selecting members to invite. I need to:

1. Search for "yjlou" in the member search box
2. Select the "Guest" role (which appears to be already selected)
3. Click the "Add to project" button

The search box for inviting members has bid "490" according to the accessibility tree. I'll start by searching for "yjlou" there.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "yjlou" into the member search box (bid 490), and the accessibility tree shows that there's a dropdown result available for "yjlou @yjlou" (bid 646). The "Add to project" button is currently disabled, which means I need to first select the user from the search results before I can proceed with the invitation.

The accessibility tree indicates there's a status message saying "One result is available, press enter to select it." I should press Enter to select the yjlou user from the search results.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "yjlou" and pressing Enter, the user should now be selected. The accessibility tree shows "yjlou @yjlou" appears in the search results area. The "Guest" role is already selected by default (as indicated by "selected=True" for the Guest option in the combobox), and the "Add to project" button (bid 512) should now be enabled and ready to use.

I need to click the "Add to project" button to complete the invitation process for yjlou as a guest member.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see from the accessibility tree that the invitation was successful - there's a status message "Users were successfully added." and yjlou now appears in the "Existing members and groups" section with "Guest" role and "Given access just now". The goal has been accomplished - yjlou has been invited to the dotfiles repository as a guest.

Since the task is complete, I should notify the user that the invitation was successful.
