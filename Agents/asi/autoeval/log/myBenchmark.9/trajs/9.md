## Intent

How many commits did kilian make to a11yproject on 3/1/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task where the user wants to know the number of commits made by a specific person on a specific date. The agent's action history shows multiple clicks and scrolls, indicating an attempt to navigate and search through the commit history. The final state of the webpage explicitly confirms that March 1, 2023, does not appear in the commit history, and the agent's response accurately states that there were 0 commits on that date. The agent has provided the requested information correctly.

Status: success

## Final Response "Kilian made 0 commits to the a11yproject on March 1, 2023. The commit history shows no activity on that date."

## Captions

===============I need to find out how many commits Kilian made to the a11yproject on 3/1/2023. Currently, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects, including "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". To get commit information, I need to navigate to that project's page first.

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see a link for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" with bid 286. Clicking this should take me to the project page where I can access commit history.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the a11yproject.com project page. I need to access the commit history to find Kilian's commits on 3/1/2023. In the navigation sidebar, I can see a link for "Repository" and within that, there should be access to commits. However, I notice there's a more direct "Activity" link in the project navigation with bid 245 that might show commit activity, or I could go directly to the commits page.

The commits link appears to be available with bid 580, which shows "1,844 Commits" - this would be the most direct way to access the full commit history where I can filter by date and author.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the commits page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch. The page shows commit history grouped by date, but all the visible commits are from 2020 (5 years ago), which is much earlier than the target date of March 1, 2023.

I need to find commits from 2023, specifically from Kilian on March 1st. Since the current view only shows older commits, I should either:

1. Scroll down to load more recent commits
2. Use the search/filter functionality to find commits from the specific date

I can see there's a search box with bid 496 labeled "Filter by commit message" - this might help me search for commits by author or date, but it's specifically for commit messages. A better approach would be to scroll down to load more recent commits first, as the page might be paginated with older commits at the top.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see that scrolling revealed more commits but they're all still from 2020 (5 years ago). The commits page I'm currently on is specifically for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch, which appears to be an older branch with no recent activity.

To find Kilian's commits from March 1, 2023, I need to:

1. Switch to the main/default branch where recent commits would be
2. Navigate to the general commits page for the entire repository (not just this specific branch)

I can see there's a button with bid 473 showing "add-color-utility-classes" - clicking this should allow me to switch branches. I'll click it to access the branch selector and choose the main branch.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that clicking the branch selector button has opened a dropdown menu showing various branches including "main" (bid 1462). Since I need to find commits from March 1, 2023, I should switch to the main branch where recent commits are more likely to be found. The "add-color-utility-classes" branch appears to be an old branch with only 2020 commits.
===============Looking at the current page after switching to the main branch, I can now see the commit history for the main branch. The page shows commits grouped by date, and I can see dates like "14 Mar, 2023", "12 Mar, 2023", "07 Mar, 2023", "05 Mar, 2023", etc.

I need to find commits specifically from March 1, 2023 (3/1/2023) by Kilian. Scanning through the visible dates, I don't see March 1 listed - the closest dates are March 5, 7, 12, and 14. This suggests there might not have been any commits on March 1, 2023, or the commits from that date are further down the page.

Let me scroll down to see if there are more commits from earlier in March 2023 that might include March 1.
===============Looking at the current state after scrolling, I can see more commit dates appearing: "02 Mar, 2023", "28 Feb, 2023", "14 Feb, 2023", etc. I still don't see "01 Mar, 2023" or "1 Mar, 2023" in the visible dates. The dates are displayed in the format "DD Mon, YYYY" (like "02 Mar, 2023").

Since March 1, 2023 would appear between February 28 and March 2, and I can see both "28 Feb, 2023" and "02 Mar, 2023" but no March 1 date in between, this strongly suggests there were no commits on March 1, 2023.

To be thorough, let me scroll a bit more to confirm there are no March 1 commits, then I can provide the answer to the user.
===============Looking at the current state after scrolling further, I can see commit dates ranging from "14 Mar, 2023" down to "18 Jul, 2022" in the accessibility tree. I've carefully examined all the visible dates and there is no "01 Mar, 2023" or "1 Mar, 2023" listed among the commit dates. The closest dates are "02 Mar, 2023" (which shows 3 commits) and "28 Feb, 2023" (which shows 3 commits), with no March 1 date in between.

Since I've thoroughly scrolled through the commit history and confirmed that March 1, 2023 does not appear as a commit date in the repository, I can conclude that Kilian made zero commits to the a11yproject on 3/1/2023.
