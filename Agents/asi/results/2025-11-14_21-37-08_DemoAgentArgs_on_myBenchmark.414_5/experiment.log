Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "byteblaze/dotfiles" project and navigate to it so I can change its LICENSE to MIT.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed with a link element that has bid 545. This appears to be the project link I need to click to navigate to the dotfiles repository.

```click("545")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the byteblaze/dotfiles project page (as indicated by the title "Byte Blaze / dotfiles · GitLab" and URL). I need to find where to add or modify the LICENSE file. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a link with the text "Add LICENSE" that has bid 904. This appears to be exactly what I need to create a new LICENSE file with MIT license content.

```click("904")```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're on the "New File" page for the dotfiles repository, specifically set up to create a LICENSE file. The page shows:

1. A file name field already pre-filled with "LICENSE"
2. An editor content area where I need to enter the MIT license text
3. A commit message field pre-filled with "Add LICENSE"
4. A target branch field set to "main"
5. A "Commit changes" button

Since the goal is to make the LICENSE MIT, I need to fill the editor content with the standard MIT license text. The editor content textbox has bid 832, so I should fill it with the MIT license content.

Looking at the current state, I can see that the editor content area (bid 832) already contains some text that appears to be part of a license (mentions "THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS'", etc.), but it's incomplete and doesn't include the full MIT license header. The goal is to ensure the LICENSE file contains the complete MIT license text. Since the editor is already focused and contains partial license content, I should replace it entirely with the complete, standard MIT license text.

Looking at the current state, I can see that the editor content area (bid 832) already contains some license text, but it's incomplete and appears to be just the latter portion of a license. The goal is to create a complete MIT license file. I've already attempted to fill the editor with the full MIT license text, but let me verify the current content and ensure it's properly set.

The accessibility tree shows the current editor content value as: " or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS orIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THEAUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,\nOUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THESOFTWARE."

This confirms the editor only contains the latter part of a license agreement. I need to replace this with the complete MIT license text. Since the editor is already focused, I'll use the fill action to replace the entire content with the standard MIT license.
